## About this project
We are creating an AI recycling assistant web app that helps users sort their waste correctly. The user will take a picture of an item they want to dispose of, and the AI will analyze the image and provide whether the item is recyclable or not. We are using Next.js for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend and TensarFlow for the AI model. We got dataset from Kaggle which is stored in a google drive folder into the train, test and validation folders. We are a bunch of freshmen college studnets that are new ML and web development. We need help figuring out what specific tasks to do what the next steps are. But do not do the work for us as we want to learn by doing it ourselves. Please help us by giving specific tasks to do and next steps to take. Also help us understand the code wrote so far by other members of the team.
